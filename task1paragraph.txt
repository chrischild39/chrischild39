The system will handle keeping track of the provider and member records.  The system will also automatically verify member records when a card is swiped, and will automatically interact with the billing database.  All the member and provider records will be stored in a central server, from which the ChocAn database will be hosted.  The central server will need to be robust and have sufficient space to hold all the records.  The system will need to interact with the billing database as well as the membership card system to record service provision.  Members will have minimal interaction with the system; they will interact to find service providers, as well as indirect interaction via membership cards.  Providers will interact by billing ChocAn for services and member validation, and accessing the provider direcftory upon request.  Operators will be able to access the system in a variety of ways.  They will be able to add, update, and remove member and provider records.  The manager will be able to generate member, provider, and summary reports.
